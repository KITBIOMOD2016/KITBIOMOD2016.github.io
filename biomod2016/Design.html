<div id="01"><font size="5">1. What is logic gate</font></div><BR>
<BR>
It is the circuit which does logic operation.<BR>
In general, logic gate has two Inputs, and divide them into High and Low by the threshold.<BR>
Logic circuit is used as the smallest modules which compose all digital circuit, so it is essential for recent electric products. <BR>
In other words, when we produce some systems, we need the smallest modules, so we think need the smallest modules when we produce some systems in a DNA reaction system.<BR>
Therefore, we need logic gate when we produce something with DNA.<BR>
AND, OR, NOT is in logic gate. <BR>
Their work is expressed by a truth table. <BR>
AND, OR, and NOT are called basic logic gates.<BR>
 In general, we can make one-step large module, XOR, NOR, and NAND by combining basic logic gates. <BR>
Moreover, we can make larger module, flip-flop, register, and so on by combining XOR, NOR, NAND, and basic logical gates.<BR> 
We can make a product such as a microcomputer by repeating combining modules. Because Computer is a machine for computing literally,<BR>
it needs modules for computing. One of them is an accumulator.<BR>
For making an accumulator, we need XOR.<BR>
Like this, XOR is an important module, so we make XOR.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<div id="02"><font size="5">2. What is XOR</font></div><BR>
XOR works like the next truth table. <BR>
Now the XOR which we regard a concentration of DNA as Inputs because the XOR is made in DNA reaction system. <BR>
Only when High or Low is inputted, Output becomes High. When Inputs are High-High or Low-Low, Output becomes Low.<BR>

    <BR>

As mentioned in 1, basically, a big module is made by combining small modules.<BR>
At first, we consider making XOR by combining AND, OR, NOT, but it needs many DNA strands for making and is a complex reaction system. <BR>
A complex reaction system is bad for making something. The reason is, in DNA reaction system, a complex condition tends to occur the reaction which we don’t hope. <BR>
Moreover, the more complex a reaction system is, the later a reaction velocity is. <BR>
For solving the weak points, we contrived DNA Interference Detector.<BR>
We explain DNA Interference Detector in 3.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<div id="03"><font size="5">3. DNA Interference Detector</font></div><BR>
<BR>
<font size="5">3.1 What is DNA Interference Detector</font><BR>
We named the XOR which we contrived DNA Interference Detector.<BR>
DNA Interference Detector solved the weak points XOR by combinational circuit.<BR> 
XOR combined by AND, OR, and NOT needs many DNA strands (83 strands), but Our DNA Interference Detector can performs alone the function of XOR, and it is made in a few strands (31 strands).<BR>
Moreover, DNA Interference Detector is faster than combinational XOR about a reaction velocity. <BR>
The difference about a reaction velocity is 15o minutes. <BR>
<BR>
<font size="5">3.2 Reaction path</font><BR>
We designed DNA Interference Detector based on strand displacement reactions.<BR>
This gate is composed of four DNA strand displacement reaction processes.<BR> 
We explain each of reaction processes below.<BR>
<BR>
<strong>First Process:<BR></strong>
As shown Figure 3-1, “Input1” including a ss1 TT1 s3 sequence is single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and “Makestopper1” is double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that includes a toehold domain TT1*.<BR>
”Input1” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT1, yielding “Stop1”, “Next1-1” and “Waste”.  <BR>
Similarly, “Input2” causes a strand displacement reaction with “Makestopper2” and results in “Stop2”, ”Next2-1” and “Waste”. <BR>

<strong>Second Process:</strong><BR>
Next, “Next1-1” produced at First Process and “Makecutter1” cause a stand displacement reaction and “Makecutter1” is replaced by “Next1-2”, ”Next1-3” and “Waste”.<BR>
In the same way, “Makecutter2” causes a strand displacement reaction with “Next2-1” produced at First Process, creating “Next2-2”,”Next2-3”and “Waste”.<BR> 
Figure 3-2 shows a strand displacement model of Second Process.<BR>

<strong>Third Process:</strong><BR>
In this step, four kinds of reactions can occur. <BR>
 We explain each of reactions below.<BR>
<BR>

①<BR>
“Next1-3” yielded at Second Process and “Makeoutput1” cause a stand displacement reaction based on TT5 and then “Next1-2” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT4.<BR>
 As a result, two kinds of “Waste” and “Next1-4” are produced. <BR>
 Similarly, “Next2-3” yielded at Second Process and “Makeoutput2” cause a stand displacement reaction based on TT2 and then “Next2-2” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT8. <BR>
As a result, two kinds of “Waste” and “Next2-4” are produced.  <BR>

②<BR>
“Stop2” yielded at First Process and “Makeoutput1” cause a stand displacement reaction based on TT5 and then “Next1-2” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT4. <BR>
As a result, “Waste” and “Next1-6” are produced.  Similarly, “Stop1” yielded at First Process and “Makeoutput2” cause a stand displacement reaction based on TT2 and then “Next2-2” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT8. <BR>
As a result, “Waste” and “Next2-6” are produced.<BR>

As a result, two kinds of “Waste” and “Next1-4” are produced.  Similarly, “Next2-2” yielded at Second Process and “Makeoutput2” cause a stand displacement reaction based on TT8 and then “Next2-3” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT2.<BR>

Similarly, “Next2-2” yielded at Second Process and “Makeoutput2” cause a stand displacement reaction based on TT8 and then “Stop1” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT2.<BR>

Figure3-6: Structure of Third Process
</center>
<BR>

In ① and ②, “Makeoutput1” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT5 and then based on TT4.<BR>
”Makeoutput2” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT2 and then based on TT8. <BR>
On the other hand, in ③ and ④ “Makeoutput1” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT4 and then based on TT5.<BR>
“Makeoutput2” causes a strand displacement reaction based on TT8 and then based on TT2.<BR>
As shown Figure3-4 or Figure3-6, toehold domain stTT5* of “Makeoutput1”, stTT2* of “Makeoutput2”, stTT5 of “Stop2” and stTT2 of “Stop1” consist of seven bases.<BR>
Against it, toehold domain TT5 of “Next1-3” and TT2 of “Next2-3” consist of five bases.<BR>
Therefore, in terms of length of toehold, a strand displacement reaction based on stTT5 is faster than that based on TT5.<BR>
A strand displacement reaction based on stTT2 is similarly faster than that based on TT2. <BR>
In other words, four kinds of reactions(①-④) depend on concentration of “Next1-3”, that of “Stop2”, that of “Next2-3”, and that of “Stop1”.<BR>
When a concentration of “Next1-3” is higher than that of “Stop2”, reaction①　or reaction③ occur. <BR>
On the other hand, if a concentration of “Stop2” is higher than that of “Next1-3”, reaction② or ④ occur.<BR>
As the same way, when a concentration of “Next2-3” is higher than that of “Stop1”, reaction① or reaction③ occur.<BR>
If a concentration of “Stop1” is higher than that of “Next2-3”, reaction② or ④ occur.  <BR>
Each concentration of “Next1-3”, “Stop2”, “Next2-3” and “Stop1” depend on that of “Input1” or “Input2”, so we defined those four concentrations by concentrations of “Input1” and “input2”.<BR>
<BR>

<strong>Fourth Process:</strong><BR>
Finally, “Next1-4” or “Next2-4” produced at Third Process and “Fluorescence” cause a stand displacement reaction and “Fluorescence” is replaced by “Fluorescence output” and “Waste”.<BR>
We designed fluorescent molecules on 5’ end of ss3 and quencher molecules on 3’end of ss3*.<BR>
Therefore, when “Next1-4” (or “Next2-4”) and “Fluorescence” cause a stand displacement reaction, we can observe fluorescence.<BR>
Figure3-7 shows a strand displacement model of Fourth Process.<BR>
